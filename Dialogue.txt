Once, there was a village. The village of shapes. This village was home to many shapes. In this village, shapes that were the same would match to become happy.
Except for one. The evil Shapeulese. Shapeulese was mis shapen, so he couldn't match with any other shapes. This made him very unhappy.
Eventually, he decided that no other shape could be happy, so he decided to kidnap them all, to prevent them from matching.
Soon, the day came, and he put his plan into action. He kidnapped all of the shapes, but he missed one.

Hey you, what are you doing.
I am kidnapping all of the shapes, to make them unhappy.
Let them go.
No.
You'll never get away with it, I won't let you.
I already have gotten away with it.
No you haven't, you're still here, I can still stop you.
You can't stop my amazing escape.
What escape, you're not even moving.
Hey! Stop moving! Get back here you evil villain.
Stop chasing me.
No.
Then I'll throw shapes at you to trip you.
I'll just match them to keep them out of the way, and catch you.
You can try.


Ha, I caught you. The shapes are free.
No! I will not accept this! I will have my revenge!
And thusly did the tale of Shapeulese draw inexorably to its conclusion. Until next time.
